# SK6812viaSPI
This repo contains basic driver code in C++ & Arduino C++ that allows you to drive SK6812, WS2812, WS2812B/Neopixels using the SPI port. Only the MOSI(DATA) pin of the SPI port is required. Below are the platforms that this has been tested on.
HIGHLY recomend using pixel 0 as a NULL pixel to boost 3.3v to 5v for all 3.3v boards or an equivelent high speed Voltage Level Shifter.

# ESP8622 & ESP32
YES

# Raspberry Pi via BCM2835 libarry 
YES but NO. SPI Transfers "can and will" be interupted by the OS, as your program runs in userspace so this will probbaly never work

# Raspberry Pi via SPIDEV
YES - Make sure your spi bufsiz=LARGE_ENOUGH NumofPixels x 12 = bytes per SPIFrame required

* Add the following at the end of /boot/cmd.txt, note im setting the buffer size to 1024000 bytes

  > sudo nano /boot/cmd.txt
  
  Add this to the end of the line
  
  > spidev.bufsiz=1024000
  
* Reboot the pi and run this to check that the setting has been made permenantly

  > cat /sys/module/spidev/parameters/bufsiz

# NanoPi Neo Air (using the Matrix GPI library)
YES

# NanoPi Neo Air (using native SPIDEV)

YES - Make sure your spi bufsiz=LARGE_ENOUGH NumofPixels x 12 = bytes per SPIFrame required
* Create an executable script in /root
		
  > nano /root/setSPIBufSize
    
* Add the following 2 lines, note im setting the buffer size to 1024000 bytes

  > chmod 666 /sys/module/spidev/parameters/bufsiz
 
  > echo 1024000 > /sys/module/spidev/parameters/bufsiz
	
* Make the file executable 
    
  > chmod 777 /root/setSPIBufSize
    
* Edit the startup script /etc/rc/local and add the following line

  > sudo nano /etc/rc/local
  > sudo /root/setSPIBufSize

* Reboot the device and check that the setting has been done

  >cat /sys/module/spidev/parameters/bufsiz
  This should output 1024000
  
* Compile the exampl with this command

  > g++ -o sk6812viaspi sk6812viaspi.cpp NeoViaSPI.cpp
  
* Run it as root or the SPIDEV will not open

  > sudo sk6812viaspi

# NanoPi DUO (using native SPIDEV) IN DEVELOPMENT

YES - Make sure your spi bufsiz=LARGE_ENOUGH NumofPixels x 12 = bytes per SPIFrame required
* Create an executable script in /root
		
  > sudo nano /boot/boot.cmd
    
* Add the following boot-time argument to the end of the boot args line, note im setting the buffer size to 1024000 bytes

  > spidev.bufsiz=1024000
	
* Recompile using 
    
  >  mkimage -C none -A arm -T script -d boot.cmd boot.scr

* Reboot the device and check that the setting has been done

  >cat /sys/module/spidev/parameters/bufsiz
  This should output 1024000
  
* Compile the exampl with this command

  > g++ -o sk6812viaspi sk6812viaspi.cpp NeoViaSPI.cpp
  
* Run it as root or the SPIDEV will not open

  > sudo sk6812viaspi
  
# STM32F103C(bluepill)
YES - But flaky because we can not set the SPI frequency without using a divider and the closes one causes some minor issues on the last pixel
